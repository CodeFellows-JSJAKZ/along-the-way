[Guide to development setup](https://gist.github.com/aisapatino/fb5770a0bcaa87d6f51f)

## Required functionality

### Commonly used words explained

*location === city, neighborhood etc.
*place === store, business, restaurant etc.

###Initial simplified version

Client lists a batch of towns or cities along their travel route where they
 might be willing to stop, and gets back a list of all of the things there.

###Features to add

* Client can specify the kinds of places of interest to restrict the lists
* Client can give a route with a maximum distance from the highway they'd be
  willing to travel.
* Client on a smartphone/tablet-like device can use the touch screen to set
  the search range relative to the route and explore the choices.
* Client wouldnâ€™t mind using it to plan errands on the way home from work.

## Process

* Agile, iterative
* Have your client actually drive the code and give you feedback
* If you get a question during your process, you can and should ask your
  client for feedback.

## Timeline

* Sprint 1: May 12 - 16
    * Initial set of user stories and wireframes based on the minimal
      system described
* Sprint 2: May 17 - 23
    * At least the working minimal system
    * Whatever additional (client approved) users stories you may have
    * Come up with additional user stories at that point and have them
      prioritized
* Sprint 3: May 24 - 30
    * Present project on May 30
